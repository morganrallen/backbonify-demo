Demo application demonstrating using browserify and Backbone in a modular fashion. Might not be a 100% 'correct way' of using either but it is the process I have developed into.

Installation
====
```
git clone https://github.com/morganrallen/backbonify-demo
cd backbonify-demo
npm install
npm run build
npm serve
```
